## 🔒 Disclaimer & Limitations

### Scope Boundaries
This audit portfolio represents point-in-time security assessments. Each audit is limited to:
- Specified contract scope and version
- Analysis timeframe constraints  
- Available documentation and specifications
- Third-party dependency surface area

### Important Considerations
- **No Absolute Security**: Audits reduce but cannot eliminate all risks
- **Code Evolution**: Post-audit changes may introduce new vulnerabilities
- **Ongoing Vigilance**: Regular re-assessment recommended for production systems
- **External Dependencies**: Third-party integrations require separate evaluation

### Professional Standards
All audits are conducted with professional diligence but do not constitute financial advice, investment recommendations, or absolute security guarantees. Users should conduct their own due diligence and consider multiple security opinions for critical deployments.
